# 0x0A. Configuration management

### Project Overview

This project aims to provide a hands-on introduction to configuration management using Puppet. You will be tasked with creating Puppet manifests to manage various aspects of an Ubuntu system, including installing software, configuring services, and managing files.

### Prerequisites

* A working Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment
* A basic understanding of Linux commands
* Familiarity with programming concepts

### Requirements

* All files must be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All files must end with a newline character
* A `README.md` file must exist at the root of the project directory
* Puppet manifests must pass `puppet-lint` version 2.1.1 without any errors
* Puppet manifests must run without errors
* The first line of each Puppet manifest file must be a comment explaining the purpose of the manifest
* Puppet manifest files must have the `.pp` extension

### Installation Instructions

Before beginning the project, ensure you have the necessary tools installed on your Ubuntu system:

1. **Install Ruby and related packages:**

```bash
$ apt-get install -y ruby=1:2.7+1 --allow-downgrades
$ apt-get install -y ruby-augeas
$ apt-get install -y ruby-shadow
$ apt-get install -y puppet

$ gem install puppet-lint


Note: You do not need to attempt to upgrade Puppet versions. This project focuses on basic syntax, which is consistent across different Puppet versions.
